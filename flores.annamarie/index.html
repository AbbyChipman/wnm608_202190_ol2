We offer produce from multiple sources around our local community so we can provide a wide selection of food and items. </p>
				<p>Anna has been an active member in the farming community so she started her own business is San Diego California. Her first plants were spearmint and rosemary and after she saw them thrive and grow she decided to plant more in her backyard. After her journey into the world of plants and edible foods she built her own business with the purpose of selling various types of produce from other farmers around her area. Her network grew and now her business has moved to San Francisco where she began to offer delivery services for those who needed fresh produce hand picked and carried to those in need.</p>
