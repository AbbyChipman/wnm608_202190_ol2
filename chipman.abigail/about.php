            <h2>About Us!</h2>
            <p>If you like glitter, bright colors and fun as much as I do, you're in the right place! The  main focus of AbbyDazzled Designs is stationery items like notebooks, ink pens, bookmarks and accessories like pencil cups and notebook charms, all with an eye toward fun. We even have a special line of notebooks and journals for the southpaw in your life.</p>
            <p>Take a look around at all my "dazzling" designs (yes, I went there), and if you don't see what you're looking for, just let me know. Custom orders are no problem!</p>
